## SLIDE 2: The Problem

### IT Portfolio Chaos is Costing You Millions

**Left side - The Reality:**
- 200+ applications accumulated over decades
- Redundant systems doing the same thing
- Legacy apps nobody wants to own
- Budget conversations driven by politics, not data

**Right side - The Cost:**
- **30-40%** of applications are redundant or underutilized
- **$100K-$500K+** wasted annually on retirable apps
- **Hidden risks** in unassessed applications
- **IT burnout** from supporting too many systems

**Bottom text:**
*"We have 211 applications and I can't tell the board which ones are worth keeping."*

---

## SLIDE 3: The Questions Leaders Can't Answer

### What keeps CIOs up at night

**Big questions (with question marks):**

1. "Which applications should we invest in vs. retire?"
2. "Where are our compliance and security risks?"
3. "How do I cut 15% without damaging the business?"
4. "What's the true cost and value of each application?"
5. "How do stakeholders actually feel about these systems?"

**Bottom text:**
*Without objective data, every decision becomes political.*

---

## SLIDE 4: Our Solution

### AI-Powered Application Rationalization

**Big text:**
> "We turn application chaos into actionable insights—combining quantitative scoring with stakeholder perspectives to deliver clear recommendations."

**Three pillars (icons):**
1. **Complete Visibility** — Score every application across 7 dimensions
2. **Strategic Framework** — TIME categorization for clear action
3. **Data + Human Insight** — 30+ structured interview questions

---

## SLIDE 5: The TIME Framework

### Every Application Gets a Strategic Category

**Quadrant diagram:**

```
                Technical Quality
                Low    →    High
              ┌────────┬────────┐
Business      │TOLERATE│ INVEST │
Value    High │        │        │
              ├────────┼────────┤
         Low  │ELIM-   │ MIGRATE│
              │INATE   │        │
              └────────┴────────┘
```

**Quadrant descriptions:**
- **INVEST:** High value, good health → Enhance and grow
- **TOLERATE:** High value, poor health → Plan modernization
- **MIGRATE:** Low value, good health → Consolidate
- **ELIMINATE:** Low value, poor health → Retire

---

## SLIDE 6: How It Works

### Five-Step Process

**Flow diagram:**

```
1. COLLECT → 2. SCORE → 3. INTERVIEW → 4. ANALYZE → 5. ROADMAP
```

**Step details:**

| Step | What Happens | Output |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **Collect** | Upload portfolio data | Validated inventory |
| **Score** | AI scores 7 dimensions | Composite scores (0-100) |
| **Interview** | 30+ questions per stakeholder | Qualitative insights |
| **Analyze** | ML clustering, compliance checks | Patterns and risks |
| **Roadmap** | Prioritized recommendations | Action plan |

---

## SLIDE 7: Seven Scoring Dimensions

### Comprehensive Multi-Factor Analysis

**Circular diagram showing 7 dimensions:**

| Dimension | Weight | What We Measure |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Business Value | 25% | Strategic importance, revenue impact |
| Tech Health | 25% | Maintainability, technical debt |
| Security | 15% | Security posture, vulnerabilities |
| Strategic Fit | 15% | Alignment with business strategy |
| Cost Efficiency | 10% | Value per dollar spent |
| Usage | 10% | Active utilization level |

**Key point:**
*Weights are customizable to match your organization's priorities.*

---

## SLIDE 8: Stakeholder Assessment

### Data Can't See Everything—People Can

**The gap:**
"Technical data shows SAP has high usage. Stakeholder interviews reveal users hate it and work around it constantly."

**Our approach:**
- **30+ structured questions** across 7 categories
- **Multiple stakeholder perspectives** per application
- **Quantitative + qualitative** combined scoring
- **Sentiment analysis** of open-ended responses

**Categories covered:**
1. Business Value & Criticality
2. User Satisfaction & Experience
3. Technical Health & Sustainability
4. Change Readiness
5. Dependencies & Integration
6. Cost Awareness
7. Future Needs

## APPENDIX B: Scoring Methodology

### How Composite Scores Are Calculated

**Formula:**
```
Composite Score = (

    Tech Health × 25% +
    Security × 15% +
    Strategic Fit × 15% +
    Cost Efficiency × 10% +
    Usage × 10%
) × 10
```

**Score interpretation:**

| Score Range | Recommendation | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| 70-100 | Invest | Enhance and grow |
| 55-69 | Maintain | Standard support |
| 40-54 | Tolerate | Monitor, plan improvements |
