### The Challenge

Government IT portfolios grow organically over decades. The result? Taxpayer dollars wasted on redundant, aging, and underutilized systems.

- **30-40%** of government applications are redundant or underutilized
- **$100K-$500K+** wasted annually on applications that could be retired
- **Unknown compliance risks** hiding in unassessed applications
- **IT staff burnout** from supporting too many systems with too few resources
- **No single source of truth** for application portfolio decisions

---

### The TIME Framework

We categorize every application into strategic quadrants:

```
                Technical Quality
                Low    →    High
              ┌────────┬────────┐
Business      │TOLERATE│ INVEST │
Value    High │ Plan   │ Grow & │
              │ Modern │ Enhance│
              ├────────┼────────┤
         Low  │ELIM-   │ MIGRATE│
              │INATE   │ Consol │
              └────────┴────────┘
```

- **INVEST:** Strategic apps—enhance and grow
- **TOLERATE:** Critical but aging—plan modernization
- **MIGRATE:** Good tech, low value—consolidate
- **ELIMINATE:** Retire and save
