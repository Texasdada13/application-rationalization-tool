# Application Rationalization Tool - One-Pager

## What It Is

A comprehensive platform that transforms application portfolio chaos into actionable insights through automated scoring, stakeholder assessment, and data-driven recommendations.

---

## The Problem

**Organizations waste 30-40% of IT spend on the wrong applications.**

- CIOs manage 200+ applications with no clear view of what to keep, retire, or invest in
- $100K-500K+ wasted annually on redundant and underutilized systems
- Decisions driven by politics and gut feel instead of objective data
- Hidden security vulnerabilities and compliance risks in aging applications
- Post-merger duplication and technical debt accumulation

**Bottom line:** Application chaos leads to wasted money, increased risk, and missed strategic opportunities.

## The Solution

**Data-driven portfolio optimization that combines quantitative metrics with stakeholder insights.**

### How It Works
```
COLLECT → ASSESS → INTERVIEW → ANALYZE → ROADMAP
```

1. **Collect** application inventory data (costs, owners, usage, tech stack)
2. **Score** every application on business value and technical health
3. **Interview** stakeholders using 30+ structured questions across 7 categories
4. **Analyze** using TIME Framework, ML clustering, compliance checks, and risk assessment
5. **Generate** prioritized roadmap with specific recommendations for each application
