## Cold Outreach

### Template 1: The Problem Opener (Government/Healthcare)

**Subject:** [Organization]'s application portfolio visibility

Hi [First Name],

I was looking at [Organization]'s recent [budget report / annual report / IT initiative] and noticed you're investing significantly in digital transformation.

Quick question: Do you know how many applications you're currently managing? Most organizations we work with estimate 150—then discover it's actually 250+.

We've built an AI-powered platform that scores every application across 7 dimensions and identifies which ones to invest in, modernize, or retire. On a recent 211-application portfolio, we identified $4.5 million in annual savings.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if there's a fit?

[Your Name]

P.S. Here's a quick overview of our approach: [Link to One-Pager]

### Template 2: The Budget Pressure Angle

**Subject:** When the CFO asks for 15% cuts

Hi [First Name],

Budget season is coming. The CFO will ask for cuts. Your department heads will all claim their applications are critical.

Sound familiar?

Most IT leaders we talk to face the same challenge: no objective data to drive those decisions. It becomes political instead of practical.

We've built a platform that scores every application in your portfolio—business value, technical health, security, cost—so you can make data-driven decisions. Our clients typically identify 20-25% in savings opportunities.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how this might help [Organization] navigate budget discussions?

[Your Name]

---

### Template 3: The Compliance Angle (Healthcare)

**Subject:** HIPAA compliance across your application portfolio

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: If an auditor asked you tomorrow which applications handle PHI and what controls are in place, how long would it take to answer?

Most healthcare IT leaders tell us: "Too long."

We've built a platform that assesses every application in your portfolio against HIPAA requirements—automatically. You get a compliance score, gap analysis, and remediation priorities for your entire portfolio.

On a recent 211-application assessment, we achieved 71.1% HIPAA compliance visibility with a clear remediation roadmap.

Worth 15 minutes to explore?

[Your Name]

---

### Template 4: The M&A Trigger

**Subject:** Post-merger application integration

Hi [First Name],

Congratulations on [Organization]'s recent [acquisition/merger with Company].

When organizations combine, IT portfolios multiply—and so does redundancy. Two CRMs, two HR systems, two of everything.

We've built a platform specifically for this challenge. We score all applications from both organizations, identify overlaps, and create a prioritized integration roadmap.

One healthcare client eliminated 40% of duplicate applications post-merger, saving $3M annually.

Would it make sense to discuss how we might help with your integration?

[Your Name]

---

### Template 5: The Modernization Angle

**Subject:** Which applications to modernize first?

Hi [First Name],

Everyone talks about digital transformation. But when you have 200+ applications, where do you start?

Modernizing everything is impossible. Doing nothing isn't an option. The question is: which applications deserve investment, and which should be retired?

We've built an AI-powered platform that answers that question with data. We score every application across 7 dimensions and categorize them into strategic quadrants—Invest, Tolerate, Migrate, or Eliminate.

The result? A clear, prioritized roadmap instead of political debates.

Would you be open to a conversation about what this could look like for [Organization]?

[Your Name]

---

### Template 6: The Value-First Approach

**Subject:** Resource: Application rationalization framework

Hi [First Name],

I put together a guide on how IT leaders are using the TIME framework (Tolerate/Invest/Migrate/Eliminate) to make portfolio decisions. No pitch—just practical insights.

[Link to resource or attach PDF]

Key takeaway: Organizations that score their applications objectively identify 20-25% in savings that political processes miss.

If you want to discuss how this applies to [Organization], I'm happy to chat. But the resource is yours regardless.

## Follow-Up Sequences

### Sequence 1: After No Response (3-email sequence)

**Email 1 (Day 3):**

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject]

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to make sure this didn't get buried. The $4.5M savings I mentioned—here's a quick case study showing how we identified it:

[Link to case study]

Worth exploring for [Organization]?

[Your Name]

---

**Email 2 (Day 7):**

**Subject:** Different angle

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a couple times about application portfolio visibility. Maybe that's not the right fit right now.

Curious—what's the biggest IT challenge on your plate this quarter?

Even if we're not the right solution, I might be able to point you in a helpful direction.

[Your Name]

---

**Email 3 (Day 14):**

**Subject:** Closing the loop

Hi [First Name],

I'll take the hint—this probably isn't the right time.

I'll stop reaching out, but if [Organization] ever needs help with:
- Application portfolio assessment
- Compliance visibility (HIPAA, SOX, PCI)
- M&A application integration
- IT budget rationalization

Feel free to reach out. I'm here when the timing is right.

[Your Name]

P.S. One stat before I go: Organizations typically waste 30-40% of their application spend on redundant or underutilized systems. Food for thought.

## Nurture Campaigns

### Template: Monthly Value Email

**Subject:** [Month] IT Portfolio Insights

Hi [First Name],

Hope [Organization] is doing well. Wanted to share some things we're seeing in [government IT / healthcare IT / enterprise IT]:

**Trend:** Organizations are shifting from periodic assessments to continuous portfolio monitoring—catching problems before they become crises.

**Stat:** 30-40% of enterprise applications are redundant or underutilized (Gartner).

**Quick win:** Start by identifying applications with fewer than 10 active users—they're usually the first retirement candidates.

We recently helped a healthcare system identify $4.5M in savings across 211 applications. [Link to case study]

If application portfolio optimization is on your radar, let me know. Happy to share what we're learning.

[Your Name]

---

### Template: Content Share

[Your Name]

---

### Template: Re-Engagement

**Subject:** Things change - checking in

Hi [First Name],

It's been a few months since we talked about application rationalization. I know timing wasn't right back then.

Curious if anything has changed:
- New priorities for [current year/fiscal year]?
- Budget cycles aligned differently now?
- Different challenges emerging?

If portfolio visibility is still on your radar, we've made some improvements I'd love to share—including automated compliance assessment for HIPAA, SOX, and PCI.

Worth a quick call?

[Your Name]

Hi [First Name],

I hope all is well at [Organization]!

I'm in late-stage conversations with [Prospect—can name or describe generally], and they'd like to speak with someone who has been through an application rationalization assessment.

Would you be willing to take a 15-minute call with them?

I'd brief you beforehand on what they're interested in, and of course would never share anything confidential about your implementation.

Totally understand if timing doesn't work. Either way, appreciate you considering it.

[Your Name]

## Event-Triggered Templates

### Template: New CIO/CTO Announcement

**Subject:** Congratulations on the new role

Hi [First Name],

Congratulations on your new role as [Title] at [Organization]!

New IT leaders often want a clear picture of what they're inheriting. If you're looking to assess your application portfolio—what to invest in, what to retire, where the risks are—that's exactly what we do.

We've helped organizations like [similar organization] get portfolio visibility in 8-12 weeks, identifying millions in savings opportunities.

Would it be helpful to have a quick conversation about establishing your baseline?

[Your Name]

---

### Template: Budget Announcement / Fiscal Year Start

**Subject:** [Organization]'s IT budget priorities

Hi [First Name],

With [fiscal year / budget season] approaching, I imagine you're thinking about where to invest and what to cut.

Most IT leaders we work with face the same challenge: lots of opinions about which applications are critical, but little objective data.

We've built a platform that provides that data—scoring every application across 7 dimensions so budget conversations become fact-based instead of political.

Worth a conversation before budget decisions get locked in?

[Your Name]

---

### Template: Audit Finding / Compliance News

**Subject:** [Re: recent audit / compliance requirement]

Hi [First Name],

I saw [Organization] was mentioned in [audit finding / compliance news / regulatory update].

Compliance visibility across application portfolios is one of the most common gaps we see. It's hard to demonstrate controls when you don't have a complete inventory of what's handling sensitive data.

Our platform automatically assesses every application against [HIPAA/SOX/PCI/GDPR] requirements—giving you a compliance score, gap analysis, and remediation roadmap.

Would this be helpful to discuss given what [Organization] is facing?

[Your Name]

---

### Template: M&A Announcement

**Subject:** Application integration post-[acquisition]

Hi [First Name],

Congratulations on [Organization]'s [acquisition of / merger with] [Company]!

When portfolios combine, so does complexity. Two CRMs, two HR systems, multiple overlapping tools—and IT is expected to rationalize quickly.

We specialize in exactly this challenge. We can assess both portfolios, identify redundancies, and create a prioritized integration roadmap in 8-12 weeks.

Would it help to have a conversation about your integration approach?

[Your Name]

---

### Template: Conference/Event Follow-Up

**Subject:** Good meeting you at [Event]

Hi [First Name],

Great meeting you at [Conference/Event] last week. I enjoyed our conversation about [specific topic discussed].

As I mentioned, we help organizations get visibility into their application portfolios—scoring every app across 7 dimensions to identify what to invest in, modernize, or retire.

Here's the case study I mentioned: [Link]

Would you be open to a follow-up call to discuss how this might apply to [Organization]?

[Your Name]
