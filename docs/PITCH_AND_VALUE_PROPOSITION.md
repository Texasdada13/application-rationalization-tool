## How to Explain What We've Built

---

## The 30-Second Elevator Pitch

> "We've built a comprehensive platform that helps organizations make data-driven decisions about their application portfolio. It combines quantitative analysis - like costs, technical health, and usage data - with qualitative insights from stakeholder interviews to identify which applications to keep, retire, consolidate, or modernize. The result? Typically 20-30% cost savings, reduced risk, and a clear roadmap for action."

## The Problem We Solve

### The Pain Points

**For IT Leaders:**
- "We have 200+ applications and no clear view of which ones to invest in or retire"
- "I can't justify our IT budget because I don't know the true cost and value of each app"
- "We're paying for redundant systems that do the same thing"
- "Our legacy applications are holding us back, but I don't know where to start"

**For Business Leaders:**
- "IT keeps asking for more budget but can't show me the ROI"
- "Our digital transformation is stalled because we're maintaining too many old systems"
- "We acquired a company and now have duplicate applications everywhere"
- "I need to cut costs but don't know what's safe to eliminate"

**For the Organization:**
- Technical debt is accumulating
- Security and compliance risks are hidden
- Resources are spread too thin across too many systems
- No single source of truth for application portfolio decisions

### Why This Problem Matters

- **30-40%** of enterprise applications are redundant or underutilized
- **$100K-500K+** wasted annually on applications that could be retired
- **Security vulnerabilities** hide in aging, unmanaged applications
- **IT burnout** from supporting too many systems with too few resources
- **Opportunity cost** of not investing in strategic applications

## Tough Questions & Strong Answers

### "We already track our applications in ServiceNow/CMDB"

**Answer:** "That's great - you have a head start on the data collection. But CMDBs track *what you have*, not *what you should do with it*. They don't score business value, capture stakeholder sentiment, or generate rationalization recommendations. We can import from your CMDB and add the decision-making layer on top."

---

### "How is this different from just using Excel?"

**Answer:** "You could use Excel, and many do. But you'd be missing:
- Automatic scoring calculations
- Historical trend tracking
- Stakeholder interview management
- Compliance and risk assessments
- ML-powered insights
- Consistent methodology

Plus, you'd spend weeks building what we provide out of the box. The question is: do you want to build tools or deliver results?"

---

### "What if our data isn't perfect?"

**Answer:** "No one's data is perfect - that's normal. Our tool includes data quality validation that identifies gaps and issues. We also supplement quantitative data with stakeholder interviews, which often reveal insights that aren't in any system. The goal is *good enough* data to make *better decisions* than you're making today."

---

### "Our applications are too complex to score on a simple 1-10 scale"

**Answer:** "The scoring is customizable. You can adjust criteria weights based on what matters to your organization. And the scores aren't the final answer - they're a starting point for conversation. When stakeholders disagree with a score, that's valuable information. The goal is to surface those debates with data, not replace human judgment."

---

### "Stakeholders will just rate their applications highly to protect them"

**Answer:** "That's a valid concern, and it's why we capture multiple stakeholder perspectives for each application. When the business owner gives 9/10 but the IT team gives 4/10, that variance is meaningful. We also include objective questions that are harder to game - like 'How many bugs do you encounter daily?' The structured format reduces bias compared to open-ended interviews."

---

### "How do you handle applications with dependencies?"

**Answer:** "Dependency mapping is a core feature. We track upstream and downstream integrations for every application. The recommendations account for these - we won't suggest retiring an app that feeds into 10 other systems without flagging the impact. The roadmap sequences retirements to respect dependency chains."

---

### "Our executives won't trust a tool's recommendations"

**Answer:** "The tool doesn't make decisions - it informs them. Every recommendation comes with supporting data: scores, stakeholder feedback, cost analysis, risk factors. Executives can drill into any recommendation and see exactly why it was made. The final call is always human. We just make sure that decision is informed by complete data."

---

### "How long does an assessment take?"

**Answer:** "A typical engagement is 8-12 weeks for a portfolio of 100-300 applications:
- Weeks 1-2: Setup and data collection
- Weeks 3-5: Stakeholder interviews
- Weeks 5-7: Analysis and scoring
- Weeks 7-9: Recommendations
- Weeks 9-12: Roadmap and deliverables

For smaller portfolios or repeat assessments, it can be faster. The tool eliminates most of the manual analysis work."

---

### "What if we've already done rationalization and there's nothing left to cut?"

**Answer:** "Even mature organizations find value. We often uncover:
- License optimization (right-sizing)
- Contract renegotiation opportunities
- Consolidation across business units
- Modernization priorities
- Risk and compliance gaps

And if you've truly optimized everything, you'll have data proving it - which is valuable for defending your budget."

---

### "How do you handle change management and politics?"

**Answer:** "Great question - that's often the hardest part. Our approach helps by:
- Using objective data to depoliticize decisions
- Including stakeholder voices so people feel heard
- Showing the 'why' behind every recommendation
- Providing executive-ready materials to build consensus
- Phased roadmaps that don't try to change everything at once

The tool creates the shared facts; you still need executive sponsorship and change management to act on them."

---

### "What about applications we don't want to retire?"

**Answer:** "Retire is just one option. Our TIME framework has four quadrants:
- **Invest**: Keep and enhance (strategic apps)
- **Tolerate**: Keep as-is for now (stable but aging)
- **Migrate**: Keep functionality, change platform
- **Eliminate**: Retire or replace

Most applications won't be eliminated. The goal is to invest in the right ones and stop investing in the wrong ones."

---

### "How do you quantify 'business value'?"

**Answer:** "Business value is scored across multiple dimensions:
- User count and usage frequency
- Revenue impact (direct or supporting)
- Process criticality
- Strategic alignment
- Stakeholder satisfaction

We also capture it through stakeholder interviews: 'What happens if this application is unavailable for 24 hours?' The combination of metrics and perspectives gives a complete picture."

## Summary: The Core Message

**What we built:** A comprehensive platform for application portfolio rationalization that combines quantitative data with qualitative stakeholder insights to generate actionable recommendations.

**Why it matters:** Organizations waste 30-40% of their application spend on redundant, underutilized, or poorly-aligned systems. Without objective data, decisions are political and slow.

**How we're different:** We built stakeholder assessment directly into the platform - capturing the qualitative insights that spreadsheets and CMDBs miss. Every feature is designed to drive toward clear action, not just more data.

**The outcome:** 20-30% cost savings, reduced risk, clear roadmap, and - most importantly - confident decisions backed by complete data.
