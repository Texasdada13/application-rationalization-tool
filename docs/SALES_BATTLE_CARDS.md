## Elevator Pitches

### 10-Second Pitch
"We help organizations see their IT portfolio clearly—scoring every application across 7 dimensions so you can decide what to invest in, modernize, or retire."

### 30-Second Pitch
"Most organizations have 200+ applications but can't answer basic questions: Which ones are worth keeping? Where are the compliance risks? What should we cut? We built an AI-powered platform that scores every application, categorizes them into strategic quadrants, and combines that with stakeholder interviews to deliver a clear, prioritized roadmap. Our clients typically identify 20-25% in cost savings."

### 60-Second Pitch
"Here's the problem: IT portfolios grow organically over decades. You end up with 200+ applications, redundant systems, hidden compliance risks, and budget conversations driven by politics instead of data.

We've built a platform that changes that. We score every application across 7 dimensions—business value, technical health, security, strategic fit, cost, usage. We categorize them using the TIME framework—Tolerate, Invest, Migrate, Eliminate. And we capture stakeholder perspectives through structured interviews that reveal what the data can't show.

On a recent 211-application portfolio, we identified $4.5 million in annual savings and flagged 60 high-risk applications that needed immediate attention.

The whole assessment takes 8-12 weeks. Would you be open to a conversation about what this could look like for your portfolio?"

## Discovery Questions

### Opening Questions
- "How many applications are in your portfolio? How confident are you in that number?"
- "When was the last time you retired an application? How did you decide?"
- "What's your biggest application portfolio challenge right now?"

### Pain Point Questions

**For CIOs/IT Leaders:**
- "If you had to cut 15% of your IT budget tomorrow, how would you decide what to cut?"
- "Do you know which applications are redundant or underutilized?"
- "How do you currently capture stakeholder feedback about applications?"
- "When was the last time you were surprised by a compliance finding?"

**For Government/Public Sector:**
- "How do you justify IT spending to the board or council?"
- "What percentage of your applications have been formally assessed?"
- "How do you handle application portfolio decisions during budget season?"
- "When did you last conduct a HIPAA or compliance assessment across your portfolio?"

**For Healthcare:**
- "How confident are you in your HIPAA compliance across all applications?"
- "How many applications handle PHI, and have they all been assessed?"
- "What's your process when auditors ask about application controls?"

### Quantification Questions
- "Can you put a number on that? What's this costing you?"
- "How many applications are in the 'we should probably retire that' category?"
- "What's your annual IT application spend? What percentage would you estimate is wasted?"
- "How many FTEs are tied up supporting legacy applications?"

### Decision Process Questions
- "Who else would need to be involved in a decision like this?"
- "What's your timeline for addressing portfolio optimization?"
- "Have you looked at other solutions? What did you learn?"
- "What would a successful outcome look like?"

## Objection Handling

### "We're too small for AI"

**Response:**
"That's actually our sweet spot. Enterprise AI has traditionally required huge budgets and dedicated data science teams. We've specifically designed this for organizations of 50-5,000 people.

Our assessments typically run $50-100K—not millions. And you don't need data scientists on staff; we handle the complexity. Our platform scored 211 applications in under 2 seconds each.

Would it help to see how similar-sized organizations have used this?"

---

### "AI is just hype / We've heard this before"

**Response:**
"I understand the skepticism—there's a lot of hype out there. That's why we focus on measurable results, not buzzwords.

Our platform identified $4.5 million in savings on a 211-application portfolio. That's not marketing—that's a validated assessment with specific applications flagged for action.

We use machine learning for specific, practical things: clustering similar applications to find consolidation opportunities, detecting anomalies in your data, analyzing stakeholder sentiment. Every recommendation has a clear rationale.

Would you like to see how we validate our models and recommendations?"

---

### "We tried application rationalization before and it didn't work"

**Response:**
"What happened? [Listen carefully]

That's a common experience, unfortunately. Most rationalization efforts fail because they're:
- Spreadsheet-based and go stale immediately
- Missing stakeholder input—just technical data
- No clear framework for decisions
- No follow-through after the initial assessment

We do things differently:
1. Automated scoring that's repeatable and updatable
2. Stakeholder interviews built into the process (30+ questions)
3. TIME framework for clear categorization
4. Prioritized roadmap with specific actions

Most importantly, we measure results. Can I show you how our approach differs?"

---

### "We don't have good data"

**Response:**
"You might have better data than you think. Most organizations have years of information sitting in finance systems, CMDBs, and contracts—they just haven't connected it.

Part of our discovery process is a data assessment. We look at what you have, identify gaps, and determine what we can work with. Our platform includes data quality validation—we don't just accept garbage in.

We've successfully built assessments with imperfect data by:
1. Focusing on available data sources
2. Supplementing with stakeholder interviews (they know things data doesn't)
3. Flagging low-confidence scores for manual review

Would you be open to a data assessment? There's no obligation."

---

### "Our stakeholders will just rate their applications highly to protect them"

**Response:**
"That's exactly why we capture multiple perspectives for each application. When the business owner gives 9/10 but IT support gives 4/10, that variance is the insight.

We also include objective questions that are harder to game:
- 'How many bugs do you encounter daily?'
- 'How much training would a replacement require?'
- 'What percentage of your team actively uses this?'

The structured format with 30+ questions reduces bias compared to open-ended surveys. And we look for sentiment signals in open-ended responses.

The goal isn't to catch people lying—it's to surface disagreements so leadership can address them."

---

### "It's too expensive"

**Response:**
"I understand budget is always a concern. Can I ask—what are you comparing it to?

Our assessments typically run $50-100K depending on portfolio size. But consider the ROI:
- We identified $4.5M in savings on a 211-app portfolio
- That's 60x return on a $75K engagement
- Typical clients see 15-25% savings opportunity

We're also flexible on structure. We can start with a smaller scope—say, just your top 50 applications—to prove value before expanding.

What budget range would make this a conversation worth having?"

---

### "We need to think about it"

**Response:**
"Of course. What specifically do you need to think through?

[Listen carefully—this usually reveals the real objection]

Is there additional information I can provide? Or would it help to involve [other stakeholder] in a follow-up conversation?

Also—what's your timeline? I want to make sure we're aligned on next steps."

---

### "Can you guarantee results?"

**Response:**
"I won't guarantee specific numbers—anyone who does is probably overselling.

What I can guarantee:
1. We'll assess every application in your portfolio
2. You'll get clear scores and categorizations
3. We'll identify savings opportunities with specific dollar amounts
4. You'll have a prioritized action roadmap

Our track record: $4.5M identified on a 211-app portfolio. But every organization is different, which is why we start with a scoped assessment before any major commitment.

The real question is: What's the cost of not having this data?"

---

### "We're locked into another vendor / We have ServiceNow"

**Response:**
"Great—ServiceNow/your CMDB is a head start on data collection. But CMDBs track *what you have*, not *what you should do with it*.

They don't:
- Score business value or strategic alignment
- Capture stakeholder sentiment
- Generate rationalization recommendations
- Assess compliance across the portfolio

We can import from your CMDB and add the decision-making layer on top. We complement, not replace, your existing investments.

What specific capability is your current tool missing?"

---

### "We just did an assessment last year"

**Response:**
"That's good! How did it go? What came out of it?

[Listen for: Was it actionable? Did they implement? Is it stale?]

Portfolio assessments should be ongoing, not one-time. We typically see:
- 20% of recommendations not implemented from prior assessments
- New applications added since the assessment
- Changing business priorities

Our platform enables quarterly reassessments to track progress and identify new opportunities. How much has changed in your portfolio since last year's assessment?"
