---

## The Problems We Solve

### Primary Problems

#### 1. **Portfolio Visibility Crisis**
**Problem:** Public works and engineering departments manage 50-200+ capital projects simultaneously across multiple phases (concept, design, ROW acquisition, construction) with no unified view of portfolio health.

**Impact:**
- Critical projects slip through the cracks
- Resource allocation decisions made blindly
- Can't answer "Which projects are actually at risk?" without weeks of manual investigation
- Executives lack confidence in project status reporting

#### 2. **Reactive Project Management**
**Problem:** Problems are discovered too late - cost overruns, schedule delays, and risk escalations only surface during monthly meetings or quarterly reviews when it's expensive to fix.

**Impact:**
- Average 15-30% budget overruns on infrastructure projects
- 40% of projects experience significant schedule delays
- Millions wasted on preventable issues (ROW complications, utility conflicts, permitting delays)
- Staff time consumed by firefighting instead of strategic planning

#### 3. **Data Fragmentation & Manual Processes**
**Problem:** Project data scattered across spreadsheets, emails, SharePoint, Primavera, construction management systems - no single source of truth. Portfolio reports require days of manual data aggregation.

**Impact:**
- 20-40 hours/month spent manually compiling portfolio reports
- Data inconsistencies and errors in executive briefings
- Inability to perform real-time "what-if" scenario planning
- Decisions delayed waiting for updated information

#### 4. **Subjective Prioritization**
**Problem:** Project prioritization driven by politics, "loudest voice," or outdated criteria instead of objective data on value, readiness, and strategic alignment.

**Impact:**
- High-value projects under-resourced while low-impact projects consume budget
- Cannot defend capital improvement plan (CIP) decisions with data
- Commission/council disputes over project selection
- Taxpayer dollars misallocated

#### 5. **Risk Blindness**
**Problem:** No systematic way to track and predict risks across right-of-way acquisition, utilities, permitting, contractor performance, environmental compliance, and funding availability.

**Impact:**
- Unexpected delays costing $50K-500K+ per project
- Federal/state grant funding jeopardized by missed milestones
- Reputation damage with elected officials and public
- Safety and compliance violations

---

## Who Experiences These Problems

### For Public Works Directors & County Engineers:
- "I have 80 active projects and can't tell you which 10 are in real trouble"
- "My team spends a week every month creating status reports instead of managing projects"
- "The commission asks 'Why is this project late?' and I don't have good answers"
- "We lost $2M in grant funding because we missed a milestone we didn't track properly"

### For City/County Managers & CFOs:
- "How do I know we're investing the $50M capital budget wisely?"
- "Projects consistently come in 20-30% over budget with no early warning"
- "I can't get a straight answer on what's at risk across our portfolio"
- "Citizens are angry about delayed road projects and I have no visibility"

### For Capital Improvement Program Managers:
- "Our CIP is a wish list, not a strategic plan backed by data"
- "I can't model 'what if' scenarios - what happens if funding drops 15%?"
- "Project prioritization is political instead of data-driven"
- "Updating project scores and status takes days of manual work"

### For Project Managers & Engineers:
- "I'm managing 5-10 projects simultaneously and drowning in status reporting"
- "I need to escalate risks but there's no systematic tracking"
- "Half my time goes to updating spreadsheets instead of solving problems"

## Why This Problem Matters - The High Cost of Poor Capital Project Management

### Financial Impact
- **$15-30 Billion** wasted annually in the US on infrastructure project cost overruns (FHWA data)
- **25-40%** typical cost overrun on poorly managed capital projects
- **$100K-1M+** per project lost to preventable delays (ROW, utilities, permitting issues)
- **Federal/state grant funding** at risk - miss milestones, lose millions

### Operational Impact
- **Staff burnout** - project managers spending 30-50% of time on reporting vs. delivery
- **Delayed infrastructure** - roads, bridges, water systems deteriorate longer
- **Opportunity cost** - wrong projects funded while critical needs wait

### Political & Reputation Impact
- **Public trust erosion** - "Why is this project 2 years late?"
- **Commission/council conflicts** - data-free debates over project priorities
- **Bond rating risk** - inability to demonstrate fiscal management of capital programs
- **Staff turnover** - talented engineers leave due to chaotic project environment

- **Health scoring** for every project using 40+ automated criteria
- **At-a-glance status** with color-coded health indicators
- **Executive summaries** ready for commission/council briefings

#### 2. **Automated Health Monitoring**
- **AI-powered scoring engine** evaluates projects across 8 dimensions:
  - Budget performance (burn rate, forecast variance)
  - Schedule adherence (milestone tracking, phase duration)
  - Risk exposure (ROW, utilities, permitting, contractor, environmental)
  - Funding security (grant compliance, cash flow)
  - Stakeholder alignment (political, community, inter-agency)
  - Regulatory compliance (permits, environmental, safety)
  - Technical readiness (design maturity, constructability)

## Use Cases / Scenarios

### 1. Preventing a Grant Funding Loss
**Situation:** County has $15M FDOT grant for bridge reconstruction, milestone approaching in 90 days but ROW acquisition stalled.

**How We Help:** Early warning system flags project as high-risk 4 months out. Dashboard shows specific blocker (2 parcels not acquired). PM prioritizes negotiations, meets milestone, saves grant.

**Outcome:** $15M in funding secured. Without early warning, would have missed deadline and lost entire grant.

---

### 2. CIP Prioritization for Budget Cut
**Situation:** City manager must cut capital budget by 20% ($10M). City engineer has 45 active projects - which to defer?

**How We Help:** Run scenario analysis showing impact of various cuts. Platform recommends deferring 8 projects (low health scores, not grant-funded, minimal disruption). Preserve 37 high-value projects.

**Outcome:** Achieved $10M savings while protecting strategic projects. Data-driven approach defended to city council, approved unanimously.

---

### 3. Portfolio Visibility for New Director
**Situation:** New public works director inherits 80 projects, no comprehensive status overview. Commission asks "What's at risk?" in week 2.

**How We Help:** Import project data in 2 days. Platform generates instant health assessment, identifies 12 high-risk projects requiring immediate attention.

**Outcome:** Director provides data-driven briefing to commission, establishes credibility, focuses team on critical issues. Avoided embarrassing "I don't know" answers.

---

### 4. Consulting Firm Differentiation
**Situation:** Engineering firm competing for $5M program management contract. Client wants to see advanced PM approach.

**How We Help:** Firm demos Capital Projects Planner as part of proposal. Shows real-time dashboard, predictive analytics, AI assistant. Client impressed by sophistication.

**Outcome:** Won $5M contract, beating 2 larger competitors. Platform becomes standard offering, wins 3 more clients.

---

### 5. Preventing Cost Overrun
**Situation:** $8M road widening project showing early signs of trouble - burn rate 15% higher than planned in month 3 of 24-month project.

**How We Help:** Platform alerts PM to budget variance. Drilling down reveals contractor using more expensive materials than specified. Issue escalated immediately.

**Outcome:** Materials corrected, contractor reimbursing $120K overcharge. Without early detection, overrun would have reached $1.2M by project end.
