# Capital Projects Lifecycle Planner - One-Pager

## What It Is

An AI-powered capital project portfolio management platform that transforms infrastructure delivery through automated health monitoring, predictive analytics, and strategic optimization for government agencies and engineering consultants.

---

## The Problem

**Government agencies waste billions on preventable capital project cost overruns and delays.**

- Public works directors manage 50-200+ projects with no unified portfolio health view
- Average 25-40% cost overruns on poorly managed infrastructure projects
- $100K-1M+ lost per project on preventable delays (ROW, utilities, permitting issues)
- 20-40 hours/month wasted manually compiling portfolio status reports
- Critical projects slip through cracks, grant funding lost due to missed milestones
- Project prioritization driven by politics instead of data

**Bottom line:** Infrastructure chaos costs taxpayers millions while staff drowns in manual reporting instead of delivering projects.

---

## The Solution

**AI-powered portfolio intelligence that predicts problems, optimizes delivery, and provides complete visibility.**

### How It Works
```
UPLOAD → SCORE → MONITOR → OPTIMIZE
```

1. **Upload** project portfolio data (Excel, CSV, or integrate with existing systems)
2. **Score** every project automatically across 8 health dimensions using AI
3. **Monitor** continuously with predictive early warning for risks and delays
4. **Optimize** portfolio with scenario modeling and strategic recommendations

### Key Capabilities

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Automated Health Scoring** | Real-time health scores (1-100) for every project across 8 dimensions |
| **Predictive Analytics** | Identify problems 3-6 months before they occur |
| **ADVANCE Framework** | Categorize projects: Advance/Monitor/Re-scope/Defer/Cancel |
| **Risk Intelligence** | Track ROW, utility, permitting, contractor, environmental risks |
| **Grant Compliance** | Federal/state milestone tracking prevents funding loss |
| **AI Assistant** | Natural language Q&A - "Which projects are over budget?" |
| **What-If Modeling** | Scenario planning for budget cuts, resource changes |
| **Commission-Ready Reports** | PDF/PowerPoint dashboards for executive briefings |

**8 Health Dimensions Tracked:**
Budget Performance • Schedule Adherence • Risk Exposure • Funding Security • Stakeholder Alignment • Regulatory Compliance • Technical Readiness • Strategic Value

## The Outcome

### Typical Results
- **40-60% reduction** in preventable cost overruns through early detection
- **80% time savings** on portfolio reporting (40 hrs/month → 8 hrs)
- **25-35% improvement** in on-time project delivery
- **95%+ grant milestone achievement** protecting federal/state funding
- **15-25% better** resource allocation and staff productivity

### Sample ROI
**100 Projects | $250M Capital Budget**
- Prevent 2 major overruns (15% on $10M projects) → $3M saved
- Accelerate 5 projects (avoid escalation) → $1M saved
- Avoid grant funding loss → $2M saved
- Staff efficiency gains → $550K saved
- **Total: $6.5M in annual value**
- **Investment:** $75K-150K
- **ROI:** 44-87x in Year 1

## What Makes It Different

### vs. Spreadsheets
Automated scoring, predictive analytics, real-time updates - not manual data compilation

### vs. Enterprise PM Tools (Primavera, MS Project)
Portfolio intelligence (not just project tracking), AI-powered, days to deploy (not months), affordable

### vs. ERP/Financial Systems (SAP, Oracle, Tyler)
Purpose-built for project delivery (not accounting), predictive (not historical), actionable recommendations

### Unique Strengths
- **Government infrastructure expertise** - Built for public sector project lifecycle
- **Predictive early warning** - See problems 3-6 months ahead
- **ROW & utility risk intelligence** - Specialized for common government challenges
- **Grant compliance built-in** - Milestone tracking and federal/state reporting
- **Commission/council ready** - Political presentation requirements understood
- **White-label capable** - Consultants can brand as their own
