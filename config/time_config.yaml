# TIME Framework Configuration
# Configure thresholds for the TIME (Tolerate, Invest, Migrate, Eliminate) framework

# TIME Framework Thresholds
# These values determine how applications are categorized into TIME quadrants
time_thresholds:
  # Business Value Threshold (0-10 scale)
  # Applications with business value >= this threshold are considered "High Business Value"
  # Default: 6.0
  # - Higher value (e.g., 7.0) = more selective, fewer apps in high-value categories
  # - Lower value (e.g., 5.0) = more inclusive, more apps in high-value categories
  business_value_threshold: 6.0

  # Technical Quality Threshold (0-10 scale)
  # Applications with technical quality >= this threshold are considered "High Technical Quality"
  # Default: 6.0
  # - Higher value (e.g., 7.0) = stricter technical standards
  # - Lower value (e.g., 5.0) = more lenient technical standards
  technical_quality_threshold: 6.0

  # Composite Score Thresholds (0-100 scale)
  # High threshold: Apps above this are generally high performers
  # Low threshold: Apps below this are generally low performers
  composite_score_high: 65.0
  composite_score_low: 40.0

  # Critical Business Value (0-10 scale)
  # Apps with business value >= this are considered mission-critical
  # Default: 8.0
  critical_business_value: 8.0

  # Poor Technical Health (0-10 scale)
  # Apps with tech health <= this are considered technically troubled
  # Default: 4.0
  poor_tech_health: 4.0

  # Poor Security (0-10 scale)
  # Apps with security score <= this are considered security risks
  # Default: 5.0
  poor_security: 5.0

# Dimension Calculation Weights
# These control how composite scores are calculated for the two TIME dimensions
dimension_weights:
  # Business Value Dimension Weights (must sum to 1.0)
  business_value:
    business_value_score: 0.5   # Direct business value assessment
    usage_score: 0.2            # Actual usage/adoption
    strategic_fit: 0.3          # Strategic alignment

  # Technical Quality Dimension Weights (must sum to 1.0)
  technical_quality:
    tech_health: 0.4            # Technical health and maintainability
    security: 0.3               # Security posture
    strategic_fit: 0.2          # Technology strategy alignment
    cost_efficiency: 0.1        # Cost effectiveness

# Normalization Parameters
normalization:
  # Maximum usage for normalization
  max_usage: 1000

  # Maximum cost for normalization
  max_cost: 300000

# Organization-Specific Customization Examples
# Uncomment and modify these to customize for your organization

# Example 1: Security-First Organization
# time_thresholds:
#   business_value_threshold: 5.5
#   technical_quality_threshold: 7.0  # Higher tech quality bar
#   poor_security: 6.0                # Stricter security threshold

# Example 2: Cost-Focused Organization
# dimension_weights:
#   technical_quality:
#     tech_health: 0.3
#     security: 0.2
#     strategic_fit: 0.2
#     cost_efficiency: 0.3            # Increased cost importance

# Example 3: Business-Value-Driven Organization
# dimension_weights:
#   business_value:
#     business_value_score: 0.6       # Higher emphasis on direct value
#     usage_score: 0.25
#     strategic_fit: 0.15

# Usage Notes:
# 1. Adjust thresholds based on your portfolio maturity
# 2. Start with defaults and iterate based on results
# 3. Document changes and rationale
# 4. Review and update quarterly or annually
# 5. Ensure stakeholder alignment on thresholds
