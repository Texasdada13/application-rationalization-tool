# Contract Oversight System - One-Pager

## What It Is

An intelligent contract lifecycle management platform that automates compliance monitoring, tracks vendor performance, and provides predictive risk intelligence to maximize contract value and prevent failures across government and enterprise contract portfolios.

---

## The Problem

**Organizations waste billions on contract mismanagement, compliance violations, and vendor underperformance.**

- Procurement teams manage 200-5,000+ contracts with no unified compliance or performance view
- $50K-500K+ lost per compliance violation (insurance gaps, regulatory violations, audit findings)
- 40-60% of contract manager time wasted on manual admin tasks (chasing insurance certs, spreadsheet tracking)
- Missed renewal dates result in unfavorable auto-renewals costing $100K-1M+
- Vendor performance issues discovered too late, after service failures or disputes
- Contract data scattered across systems - can't perform portfolio analytics or optimization

**Bottom line:** Contract chaos exposes organizations to massive risk, wastes staff time, and prevents strategic vendor management.

---

## The Solution

**AI-powered contract intelligence that automates oversight, predicts risks, and optimizes vendor value.**

### How It Works
```
IMPORT → MONITOR → ANALYZE → OPTIMIZE
```

1. **Import** existing contracts - AI extracts key terms, obligations, dates
2. **Monitor** continuously - automated compliance tracking, vendor portal for document submission
3. **Analyze** portfolio health - risk scoring, performance trends, spend analytics
4. **Optimize** strategically - consolidation opportunities, renewal vs. rebid recommendations

### Key Capabilities

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Automated Compliance Monitoring** | Track insurance, licenses, deliverables, certifications with 30/60/90-day alerts |
| **Vendor Performance Management** | Systematic scoring, multi-evaluator input, historical tracking, benchmarking |
| **Risk Intelligence** | AI predicts contract failures, compliance lapses, vendor issues 3-6 months ahead |
| **Spend Analytics** | Portfolio visibility, duplicate detection, consolidation opportunities, volume discounts |
| **Audit-Ready Reporting** | One-click compliance reports for DBE/MBE, prevailing wage, grants, regulations |
| **Vendor Portal** | Self-service document submission shifts admin burden from staff to vendors |
| **AI Contract Assistant** | Natural language Q&A - "Which contracts expire in Q2?" "Who are top risks?" |
| **Workflow Automation** | Approval routing, renewal processing, issue escalation, payment validation |

**Compliance Areas Monitored:**
Insurance Certificates • Professional Licenses • DBE/MBE Goals • Prevailing Wage • Safety Requirements • Deliverable Milestones • Grant Compliance • Environmental Regulations
